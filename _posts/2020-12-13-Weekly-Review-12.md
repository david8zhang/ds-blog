## Extra Notes

Guild Manager v.2 remains the fun hobby project. I'm pretty pleased with how that's progressing. But I don't want it to become a rigid project with "sprints" and "tickets" and all that stuff. That just makes working on it into a job. So I'm going to stop putting goals for it on the weekly review

I need to start putting some more effort into the exercise routine. I also need to get a real hobby that doesn't involve coding.
