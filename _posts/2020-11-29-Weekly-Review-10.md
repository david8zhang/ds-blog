## Extra Notes

Thanksgiving week was actually more productive than I thought it would be, although still a bit of a drop off in productivity. Also, I didn't exercise for the whole week, which is bad.

I've been procrastinating on the Push Up bank for a while now. I'm going to try and finally knock that out this week by prioritizing it as number 1.
