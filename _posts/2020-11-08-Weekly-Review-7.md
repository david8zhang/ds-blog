# Weekly Review #7

## Wins

- Made some more progress on Guild Manager v.2, implemented more of the match logic, including the hero movement, overlay menu, targeting for attack, and beginning of the attack cutscene

## Losses

- Didn't achieve the goal I set for last week, to complete the match logic implementation on Guild Manager v.2
- Didn't exercise enough

## Opportunities

- FlockTogether v.2 is beginning to restart, or at least will pick up some more steam again
- I have a new idea for an app - the Pushup Bank, which might help solve the exercise problem

## Goals for this week

- Draw up mockups for the Pushup Bank app
- Finish the attack cutscene animation
- Implement enemy attack logic

## Extra Notes

My sleep schedule has been slowly improving, but I didn't exercise nearly enough last week (only on Wednesday). I may start exercising right after work again.

Guild Manager v.2 is definitely more complicated than I probably initially thought. Implementing all the match logic in one week is definitely not doable so I set some more specific goals for myself.
