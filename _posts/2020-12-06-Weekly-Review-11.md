## Extra Notes

I worked on push up bank mockups this week, but realized I'd probably never use it. I already have Outwork as a workout tracking app, so I should just use that instead. I haven't exercised in 2 weeks now.

Guild Manager v.2 is progressing nicely and I'm having fun working on it. Seems like every week I exceed expectations on what I want to get done. I'm reading the Game Design Patterns book I bought a few months ago and I'm enjoying it.
