# Weekly Review #4

## Wins

- Made good progress on Guild Manager v.2, implemented create guild, pick heroes, season matchups

- Finally finished Pirate Manager

## Losses

- Didn't get a chance to collect feedback for FlockTogether v2, that project has sort of stalled

## Opportunities

- Got the Game Design Patterns print book in the mail, can start reading that

- Bit of a lull for FlockTogether v.2, maybe work on some QoL features like ratings and images for destination search

## Goals for this week

- Implement FlockTogether v.2 destination detailed information on search

- _Stretch: Implement some Guild Manager v.2 match logic_

## Extra Notes

I'm addicted to Genshin Impact. This week may be a total wash.
