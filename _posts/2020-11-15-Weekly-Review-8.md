# Weekly Review #8

## Wins

- Made great progress on Guild Manager v.2, finished the basic match game loop:
  - Added animations for attacks
  - Added enemy movement
  - Added a turn counter
  - Undo move and attack

## Losses

- Didn't work on the pushup bank app mockups

## Opportunities

- Guild Manager v.2 is in a good spot and I will continue to work on it

## Goals for this week

- Show the player when it's their turn v.s when it's the enemy's turn
- Hero stats
- Post match game updates (update team records)

## Extra Notes

My sleep schedule has been slowly improving, but I didn't exercise nearly enough last week (only on Wednesday). I may start exercising right after work again.

Guild Manager v.2 is definitely more complicated than I probably initially thought. Implementing all the match logic in one week is definitely not doable so I set some more specific goals for myself.
