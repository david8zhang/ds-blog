# Weekly Review #8

## Wins

- Made great progress on Guild Manager v.2, finished the basic match game loop:
  - Added animations for attacks
  - Added enemy movement
  - Added a turn counter
  - Undo move and attack
- Exercised much more than last week

## Losses

- Didn't work on the pushup bank app mockups
- A few unproductive days, trying to aim for 240 ~ 250 minutes a day of work on weekdays and 120 minutes a day of work on weekends

## Opportunities

- Guild Manager v.2 is in a good spot and I will continue to work on it

## Goals for this week

- Guild Manager v.2:

  - Show the player when it's their turn v.s when it's the enemy's turn
  - Hero stats
  - Post match game updates (update team records)

- _Optional: Do mockups for Pushup Bank_

## Extra Notes

It's pretty nice to only have to focus on a single project. I may keep working on Guild Manager until I get tired of it, then take a break and work on the Pushup Bank instead. I think it might be counter productive to do 2 projects at the same time, since the amount of context switching is pretty mentally taxing. So the plan instead is just to do 1 project for a few months, then switch to a new project, then switch back

Also, next week is Thanksgiving week, so it's likely I won't really get as much done.
