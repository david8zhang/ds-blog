# Weekly Review #4

## Wins

- Made some progress on Guild Manager, implemented part of the match logic, probably pivoting away from autosimulated games towards a turn-based tactical strategy game

## Losses

- Didn't work on FlockTogether v.2 at all
- Didn't really do very much for any of the side projects

## Opportunities

- FlockTogether v.2 is at a standstill now, seems the project is really losing steam since nobody is using it. That opens up some time to do some other things

## Goals for this week

- Finish Guild Manager v.2 match logic

## Extra Notes

As I predicted last week, Genshin Impact tanked productivity this week. But I think I'm starting to lose interest in that game so this week might be better hopefully.

Also, my sleep schedule is starting to become crap again. I need to start sleeping earlier (really trying to stick to 12 - 8 sleep schedule)
