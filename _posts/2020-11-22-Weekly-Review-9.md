# Weekly Review #9

## Wins

- Made great progress on Guild Manager v.2

  - Fix animation bugs
  - Post match stat processing, record updates
  - Added moves, animations, Magic stat

## Losses

- Only exercised once for the whole week

## Opportunities

- Should try playing a manager game to get some inspiration
- Exercising is becoming inconsistent, it might be good to start building out the Pushup Bank mockups

## Goals for this week

- Guild Manager v.2:

  - Add enemy skill usage
  - Show cutscenes for when enemies use skills

- Draw up mockups for Pushup bank

## Extra Notes

Last week was almost exclusively focused on Guild Manager v.2. The project is coming along well for the most part. This week is Thanksgiving, so I don't expect to be as productive. I'd really like to build out the Pushup Bank mockups though.
