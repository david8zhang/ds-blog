## Extra Notes

This week was starting to look like a wash, but then I actually ended up doing a bunch of stuff during the weekend. I spent almost the entirety of Saturday re-learning pixel art animations. I also did some minor investigations on Sunday looking at youtube-dl, a python library for converting youtube links to mp3 files. Finally, I had some ideas on the drive back to LA to blog about the Guild Manager v.2 development journey, since it'll be useful to look back on it and reflect.
