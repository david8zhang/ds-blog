# Weekly Review #1

## Wins

- Made considerable progress on FlockTogether v2

  - Finished Date Range voting section
  - Implemented custom date range overlap shading
  - Integrated Google Places & Google Maps into the destination voting

- Finished Lecture 4 of Fast.AI

  - Turns out last week I finished lectures 2 and 3, not 3 and 4

## Losses

- Didn't read any books at all

- Didn't work on Pirate Manager or draw any new sprites

- Didn't start on Guild Manager V2.

  - Feeling a bit of analysis paralysis around reading _Game Design Patterns_. I could probably get started on some mockups and worry about software design later

## Opportunities

- Slightly unrelated, but moved to a new location with a larger desk. More opportunities for being productive

- Destination polling on Flock Together has a lot of flexibility:

  - Our approach: Find the mid point between all lat/lng locations and suggest locations around that point.

  - On second thought, the above might be too difficult. Maybe just find a bunch of POIs around each location and have those as suggestions

## Misc Notes

- This blog post came late because I was moving. Also haven't really slept that well at night, which has been negatively impacting my morning productivity. But I'll ramp up eventually to where I was before
