## Extra Notes

Last week was pretty slow due to Christmas. I just spent all my time working on Guild Manager instead of doing the other stuff I said I was going to do. Also, I didn't exercise at all. I get the feeling this week may be similar given it's New Year's. But I'm going to at least try to accomplish other goals.
