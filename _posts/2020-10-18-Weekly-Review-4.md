## Extra Notes

Fast.ai lectures are sort of being pushed to the wayside now. I'm planning to prioritize getting FlockTogether off the ground, and developing Guild Manager v.2 as a casual hobby. I'd also rather pick back up where I left off with Unity development and continue honing my skills on that front

I'm thinking of also just doing Fast.ai whenever I have downtime at work. It's related to my job anyways. I probably won't have it listed as a goal on here for a while.
